                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>Borrowell Credit Builder is a financial product that helps members build their payment history, credit history and credit mix. The product launched in May 2022. For the MVP launch, I created email graphics.</p>

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>How do you illustrate something that isn’t a physical object?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How do you explain a complicated product?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How do you use design to help explain that product better?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How do you talk about a product that is technically an instalment loan, but one you have to pay for and not get money from, like a traditional loan?</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>Use animation to help communicate more information in less time.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Rely more on the accompanying text and use the graphic to capture attention.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Simplify the explanation text as much as possible.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>This was a self initiated project to create an explainer video for the Credit Builder product. There were A/B tests done for variations on copy on the education screen in product, without much change in results. I found the product confusing to understand and I figured our members would too.</p>

                    <h4>Thoughts that came to mind</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li>
                            <p>If changing the text doesn’t produce results, is there another way to explain the product?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The second most viewed Help Centre article regarding Credit Builder was “What is Credit Builder and how does it work?” People are navigating all of the way to the Help Centre to try and understand the product. This is an indication that the education screen in the Borrowell app could use some more help.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>People love watching videos (hence the boom of YouTube and TikTok), so why not try out this medium to explain something more complex?
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <h4>Starting with a pitch deck</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li>
                            <p>I saw a clear need for an explainer video here. I wanted to use my motion design skills in a way that would benefit Borrowell.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                    <p>I did some research around the use of videos to back up my idea.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                    </div>

                    <h4>Getting buy-in</h4>
                    <p>There was some buy-in from stakeholders after the pitch deck was presented. The initial use case for it was in the product education screen in the app. Next I wrote the script, created a rough storyboard and animatic. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="image-caption">Animatic of the explainer video</p>
                    <p>Once the stakeholders saw the video start to come to life, they got more excited about it. I worked on illustrating the storyboard with a contract designer, Brittany Edwards. I provided her with some creative direction for the first half of the storyboard, while I worked on the second half of it.

                    <h3>How success was measured</h3>

                    <p>The hypothesis of impact for a Credit Builder explainer video on the education screen in app was a 5% increase in adoption rate. The actual adoption rate ended up being 16%! That’s over 260% above target. So the overall result was that having an explainer video grew revenue by 16%.

                                <p>Video can make a notable difference in terms of metrics and user comprehension. People like watching videos and they can often help to explain things a lot easier than static illustration and text.

                                <p>Once we saw the results that an explainer video could have, it was much easier to get buy-in for another explainer video for a credit building product (Rent Advantage) that we had also launched.</p>
