                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Borrowell Credit Builder is a financial product that helps members build their payment history, credit history and credit mix. The product launched in May 2022. </p>

                                <h3>Context</h3>
                                <p>Previously users had to sign up for a free credit score account with Borrowell, then navigate to and sign up for Credit Builder in the app. This created a lot of friction and made it harder to achieve successful acquisitions. Once a separate sign up funnel was developed for the Credit Builder product, I was tasked with creating ads and a landing page.</p>

                                <p>In the past, we had found lifestyle photography to be more effective when A/B tested against illustration for free credit score ads. While most of our ads featured photography, we also continued to test some with illustrations. Launching a new product that isn't tangible and doesn't have a recognizable symbol associated with the concept, gave us the opportunity to test this again.</p>

                                <p>The biggest challenge with the paid ads campaigns is the fact that 90% of the users who clicked through and landed on the <a href="https://borrowell.com/credit-builder" target="_blank">Credit Builder page</a>  on the marketing site navigated away from it. This is seen by the fact that 64 new free credit score sign ups were attributed to the new campaigns.</p>

                        <p>To gain insights into credit building projects, I initiated competitor research by analyzing how companies are presenting their strategies. A few things were consistent between all of them: concise/catchy copy in the hero, steps/how it works section and a trust/social proof part.                        </p>

                        <p>The design of the template featured outdated branding that we had already started to phase out. To achieve the desired state of light backgrounds, I designed landing pages in a progressive manner. Initially, I updated the page content to align more closely with the Credit Builder product, incorporating testimonials specific to the product, rather than solely from the Borrowell app. Next, I created a version of the landing page with lighter backgrounds, which aligned with our branding shift, and allowed the graphics to stand out more prominently.</p>

                                    <p>Approaching communication strategically involves considering the most effective means to convey a message or provide the best experience for the user. It's important to prioritize these factors over merely fulfilling stakeholder requests. In certain cases, using animation may be more effective than static illustrations and text in explaining a concept more comprehensively.</p>
