                    <h2>Branding 2018-2023</h2>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p>In 2018, I was the first visual designer to join Borrowell. The pre-existing branding involved a logo, typeface, colour palette and an illustrated character. My initial focus was to quickly create graphic assets that could be used across marketing and email initiatives. This involved designing ads, social posts, email headers, spot illustrations and product mockups.

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li>
                            <p>The colours in the original palette clashed. There also weren’t any values of the colours provided, just the fully saturated ones.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It was difficult to create illustrations that looked cohesive together without having a pre-existing style to start from.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Initially, the established character had a simplistic style, but its young and gender-specific features raised doubts about its relatability and credibility as the face of Borrowell. Eventually, the decision was made to abandon the idea of using a mascot altogether.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Establishing style guides and templates</h3>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12"><h4>Refining the colour palette</h4></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p>In 2019, Kate Traynor and I collaborated to refine Borrowell's color palette while maintaining the original blues and purples. We added warm and cool colors to enhance hierarchy and depth in illustrations, as well as added values for each color. We also incorporated variations of blue-purple gradient backgrounds with organic shapes into Borrowell's brand language.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p>Kate started creating illustrations for each project, using purple and pink skin tones to add diversity. However, we eventually realized that natural skin tones would better represent diversity. To make finances more approachable, we opted for recognizable and relatable characters.

                    <h4>Creating templates for efficiency</h4>
                    <p>With remote work being the norm in 2020, templates became crucial for scalability as in-person explanations were no longer possible.

                    <h2>Evaluating what’s been established</h2>
                    <p>After a few years had passed, I started evaluating what had been established and whether it still met the ever-changing needs of the company.</p>
                    <p>In 2022, we shifted to lighter backgrounds. Saturated backgrounds posed a challenge for our illustrations as we wanted to maintain a hierarchy where the illustrations stood out more than the background. To achieve this, we followed the principle of desaturation as objects appear less saturated the further away they are from a viewer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="image-caption">Image of saturated vs light backgrounds with illustration on it</p>

                    <p>With the introduction of two new products in 2022, there was an opportunity to evaluate how colour could relate to each one. These financial products aren’t tangible items so we decided to use colour to help the separation. I chose a main colour for each and then worked in secondary colours that contrast well against these.</p>
                    
                    <p class="image-caption">Image representing product line colours with labels.</p>

                    <p>I switched ad templates from Canva to Figma in 2023, as auto layouts in Figma allowed for responsive templates that adjust to frame size changes. I also created reusable components for easy swapping of images, enabling quick and easy testing of multiple ad variations.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Continue to diversify our illustrated characters, including skin tone, age, culture, and physical abilities, in line with Borrowell's mission of promoting financial prosperity for everyone. </p>

                            <p>Evolve the overall messaging of Borrowell from focusing solely on “free credit score” to “building credit and achieving financial goals” so it’s more encompassing of the new credit building products that were launched in 2022.
