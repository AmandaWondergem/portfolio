                    <h2>Branding 2018-2023</h2>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>
                    <p>When I first started working at Borrowell in 2018, the pre-existing branding involved a logo, typeface, colour palette and an illustrated character. My initial focus was on creating graphics to support marketing initiatives and promote product launches in emails to the member base. This involved designing ads, social posts, email headers, spot illustrations and product mockups.</p>

                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>The colours in the original palette clashed. There weren’t any values of the colours provided, just the fully saturated ones.</p></li>
                        <li><p>It was difficult to create illustrations that looked cohesive together without having a pre-existing style to start from.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The character previously established looked very young and simple in style. I started to question whether it made sense to have her as the face of the company talking about finances. On one hand, it’s good to break the stigma and expectations around financial advisors mainly just being males, on the other hand she represents a very young, white female that might not be relatable/trustworthy for everyone. The style of the character’s facial features also didn’t translate well to a male face.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Establishing style guides and templates</h3>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12"><h4>Refining the colour palette</h4></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p>Fast forward to 2019, a junior illustrator, Kate Traynor, joined the team. I worked with her to refine Borrowell's colour palette so that the colours would work well with each other in illustrations. We wanted to keep the original feel with the blues and purples, so we used this as our starting point. We needed a balance of warm and cool colours to help with hierarchy and conveying depth in illustrations. Variations of blue-purple gradient backgrounds with organic shapes became part of Borrowell's brand language.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p class="image-caption">Image of new vs updated vs current colour palette, show the evolution</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row flip-wrap-order">
                        <div class="col-xs-12"><h4>Diversity in characters</h4></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p class="image-caption">Image of purple people vs updated vs current characters, show the evolution</p>

                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                            <p>Initially Kate and I were just creating illustrations as each new project came in. Kate wanted to add diversity in her characters, so she used purples for skin tones to achieve this. We later decided that we should stick to natural skin tones for diversity. Finances are a difficult topic for many people and we felt that using characters that are recognizable and relatable helps to give finances a more approachable feel.

                    <h4>Creating templates for efficiency</h4>
                    <p>In 2020 we were navigating working remotely and I couldn’t just pop over to someone’s desk and explain something. Templates became vital at this point.</p>
                    <p>Some thoughts that came to mind:</p>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>How can I make things more efficient for the team and myself?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How can I ensure the teams I support are using the branding in the correct way?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How can I reduce my workload on repetitive tasks so I can focus on more meaningful ones?</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Solutions:</p>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>Presentation deck template: This reduced the amount of ad hoc requests my team and I received. It also established an updated look for presentation decks that could be cohesive company wide.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Email templates and reusable components in Salesforce: This empowered the email engagement to create a variety of layouts in their emails, but still stay on-brand.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Canva ad templates: This enabled the marketing team to test copy as much as they want without needing my support to update it every time.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Templates for each file size I often worked on: This made it quicker to get started.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h2>Re-evaluating what’s been established</h2>
                    <p>After a few years had passed, I started e-evaluating what I had established and whether it still met the ever-changing needs of the company.</p>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><p>In 2022, we shifted from saturated backgrounds to lighter ones.</p></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>I worked with a contract designer, Brittany Edwards, to establish this new direction. Trying to put illustrations on saturated backgrounds proved to be very challenging because saturated colours stand out, but there also needs to be hierarchy. Ideally the illustrations should stand out more than the background and therefore should be the most saturated elements. In nature, the further things are away from a person, the more desaturated they become, so we followed this for our branding.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><p>With the introduction of two new products in 2022, there was an opportunity to evaluate how colour could relate to each one. These financial products weren’t tangible items so we decided to use colour to help the separation. We chose a main colour for each and then worked in secondary colours that contrast well against these.</p></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Free credit score = Blue</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Credit Builder = Purple</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Rent Advantage = Orange</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Financial product recommendations = Green</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><p>Initially I had set up ad templates in Canva, but then moved them to Figma in 2023.</p></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>With the addition of auto layouts in Figma, this made it easier for me to set up templates that could be responsive as I changed the frame size. I also set up reusable components to easily swap out illustrations or images so the marketing team could test even more ad variations quickly and easily.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                    <p>Once we started doing this, it became a bit quicker to begin the projects because there was a framework established to create within. It also helped to ensure everything was inline with the Borrowell brand.</p>

                                    <p>When working for a startup, it’s a fine balance of getting deliverables completed quickly to test and learn, but also establishing some guidelines to make that process easier and more efficient.</p>

                                    <p>Style guides are a great starting place for branding, but they will continually expand and evolve as the team and company needs do. Be willing to adapt the documents as things change.</p>

                                <p>I’m extremely detail-oriented and organized. I appreciate documentation and created my own often. Inconsistencies in graphics, UI screens, voice and tone of copy was something that I would often point out during design critique sessions.</p>

                                <p>Continue to evaluate processes and look for improvements. There may be some extra work upfront to establish these, but it should save time and money in the long run.</p>
