                                <p>In 2018, I was the first visual designer to join Borrowell. The pre-existing branding involved a logo, typeface, colour palette and an illustrated character. My initial focus was to quickly create graphic assets that could be used across marketing and email initiatives. This involved designing ads, social posts, email headers, spot illustrations and product mockups. 
                                </p>

                                <p>The colours in the original palette clashed. There also weren’t any values of the colours provided, just the fully saturated ones.

                                <p>It was difficult to create illustrations that looked cohesive together without having a pre-existing style to start from.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Initially, the established character had a simplistic style, but its young and gender-specific features raised doubts about its relatability and credibility as the face of Borrowell. Eventually, the decision was made to abandon the idea of using a mascot altogether.

                                <p>In 2019, Kate Traynor and I collaborated to refine Borrowell's color palette while maintaining blues and purples as the primary colours. We added warm and cool colors to enhance hierarchy and depth in illustrations, as well as added values for each color. We also incorporated variations of blue-purple gradient backgrounds with organic shapes into Borrowell's brand language.

                        <p>After a few years had passed, I started evaluating what had been established and whether it still met the ever-changing needs of the company.</p>
                        <p>In 2022, we shifted to lighter backgrounds. Saturated backgrounds posed a challenge for our illustrations as we wanted to maintain a hierarchy where the illustrations stood out more than the background. To achieve this, we followed the principle of desaturation as objects appear less saturated the further away they are from a viewer. We also introduced brand elements like imperfect, hand-drawn lines, shapes and textures to reflect human nature to have imperfections. This is in effort to make the branding distinct, but still relatable.
